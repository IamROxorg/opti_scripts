# Tweaks

This repo contains tweaks and scripts I use and create to optimize stuff on Windows and apps.  

**Apps currently tweaked:**  
- Brave Browser  

**What youâ€™ll find here:**  
- Scripts with comments explaining what they do  
- Tweaks to remove bloat and improve performance  
- Simple tools to make Windows cleaner and faster  

Use everything at your own risk, but nothing here should cause problems.

For a detailed explanation of what Useless.bat (the largest script) does, see summary.txt.
